        <h1>Martin Wagner</h1>
        <p><em>Systems Engineer for mechatronic, software and cloud solutions</em></p>
        <p>I love to work in different disciplines. So I started parallel to school to work with electronics and 2D-/3D-Graphics and games programming with OpenGL and DirectX. Then I started to play with different kind of microcontrollers to build some robots with additional sensors and motors. Then I began my study mechanical engineering and after that my first position at dormakaba.</p>
